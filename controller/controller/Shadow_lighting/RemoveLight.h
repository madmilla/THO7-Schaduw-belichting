*	@brief		This class will remove overexposure and shadows from an image.
*
*				To do this there should be taken samples, this is done in CornerPointsValues
*				When these samples are taken, they will be used to determinate if something is overexposed or a shadow or just normal light
*				If overexposure is found it will be repaired automaticly, the same goes for shadows.

	//!The samples are 9 pro corner.
	//!These samples are saved in meanRx, meanGx, meanBx and also in meanC, meanM, meanY and meanK.
	//!These samples are taken from @param image, which is a shared_ptr to the input image.
	//!The coordinates of the licenseplate are used as input using the @params, TopLeftX, TopLeftY, TopRightX, TopRightY, BottomLeftX, BottomLeftY, BottomRightX and BottomRightY.

	//!

	//!These samples are also used to determinate if something is overexposed, than this will be repaired if possible.

	//!The coordinates of the licenseplate are used as input using the @params, TopLeftX, TopLeftY, TopRightX, TopRightY, BottomLeftX, BottomLeftY, BottomRightX and BottomRightY.
