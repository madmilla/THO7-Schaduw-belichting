	Version: 0.1	7-4-2014
	Summary:		This class will remove overexposure
	Description:	This class will detect overexposure and will remove the overexposure on this image.
					How this works is simple, the constructor should be called and image should be in LAB colorspace.
					L channel from 0 to 100, other channels does not matter.
					The function thresholdrepair should be called after the class is created.
					When this function is called the Lightness channel will be scanned for a to high lightness value.
					After a to high value is found, this will be replaced by a lower value.
					A to high value is the value which is given as param to the function thresholdrepair.

	//This function will detect if a value is higher than the threshold.
	//When a value is higher this will be repaired.
